# LocalGit
After several Deleted Repos! This is the Localgit version I am looking to make public ! This repo contains c++ code that let's you run a cut down version of git on your local machine and the best part it's decentralized ! So if the server died nothing to worry about it still works since the server will be running on one of the publisher to share!
